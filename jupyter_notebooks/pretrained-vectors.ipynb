We also need to build out some infrastructure to run these models.\n","\n","Once we have the models and the boilerplate stuff out of the way, we can see the impact of pre-trained embeddings for classification tasks. Pre-training methods like word2vec are context-limited language models whose goal is to predict a word given a fixed context, or a fixed context given a word. Pre-trained embeddings are particularly useful for smaller datasets.\n","\n","Most of this code is inspired or derived from [Baseline](https://github.com/dpressel/baseline/) (Pressel et al, 2018), an open source project for building and evaluating NLP models across a variety of NLP tasks.  For this tutorial, we will only concern ourselves with Text Classification using a few useful models.\n","\n","## Word Embeddings in NLP\n","\n","We start our models with what are called \"one-hot\" vectors.  This is notionally a sparse vector with length `|V|` where V is our vocabulary, and where only the word representated at this temporal location is a 1.  The rest are zeros.\n","\n","![onehot](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/feature_columns/categorical_column_with_vocabulary.jpg)\n","\n","These vectors are not truly represented as a vector, but as an array of indices (in PyTorch, they are `torch.LongTensor`s), one for each word's index in the vocab.  This representation is not particularly helpful in DNNs since we want continuous representations for each word.\n","\n","![indices](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/feature_columns/categorical_column_with_identity.jpg)\n","\n","The general idea of an embedding is that we want to project from a large one-hot vector to a compact, distributed representation with smaller dimensionality.  We can look at this as a matrix multiply between a one-hot vector `|V|` and a weight matrix to a lower dimension of size `|D|`.  Since only a single vector value in the one-hot vector is on at a time, this matrix multiply is simplified to an address lookup in that matrix.\n","\n","![LUT](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fZj1Hk1mhS5pIMv3ZrpLYw.png)\n","\n","\n","In PyTorch, this is called an `nn.Embedding`.  In fact, in Torch7, this was called a `nn.LookupTable` which may have actually been a better name, but which seems to have fallen out of favor in DNN toolkits.  In this tutorial we are going to refer to multiple types of embeddings, and in this case, we are referring to word vectors, which are typically lookup table embeddings.\n","\n","Embeddings make up lowest layer of a typical DNN for text and we will feed their output to some pooling mechanism yielding a fixed length representation, followed by some number of fully connected layers.\n","\n","### Pre-training with Word2Vec\n","\n","There has been a large amount of research that has gone into building distributed representations for words through pre-training. Some widely used algorithms in NLP include Word2Vec, GloVe and fastText.  For instance, word2vec is actually 2 different algorithms with 2 different objectives.  They can be thought of a fixed context window non-causal LMs, but they are shallow models and extremely fast to train\n","\n","![word2vec](https://deeplearning4j.org/img/word2vec_diagrams.png)\n","\n","\n","* **CBOW objective** given all words in a fixed context window except the middle word, predict the middle word\n","* **SkipGram objective**: given a word in a fixed context window, predict all other words in that window\n","\n","Once we have trained these models, the learned distributed representation matrix can be plugged right in as our embedding weights and this often improves the model significantly.\n","\n","Before we begin, we will download some data that can be used for our experiments"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rIAhO5RRf4jL","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"outputId":"64239e21-a3cd-45dc-998a-bb80b2bdb0ae"},"source":["!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jyi4pi894bh2qh/sst2.tar.gz?dl=1\n","!tar -xzf 'sst2.tar.gz?dl=1'\n","\n","!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/08km2ean8bkt7p3/trec.tar.gz?dl=1\n","!tar -xzf 'trec.tar.gz?dl=1'\n","\n","!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/699kgut7hdb5tg9/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz?dl=1\n","!mv 'GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz?dl=1' GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz\n","!gunzip GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["--2019-06-30 01:12:58--  https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jyi4pi894bh2qh/sst2.tar.gz?dl=1\n","Resolving www.dropbox.com (www.dropbox.com)... 162.125.81.1, 2620:100:6031:1::a27d:5101\n","Connecting to www.dropbox.com (www.dropbox.com)|162.125.81.1|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\n","Location: /s/dl/7jyi4pi894bh2qh/sst2.tar.gz [following]\n","--2019-06-30 01:12:58--  https://www.dropbox.com/s/dl/7jyi4pi894bh2qh/sst2.tar.gz\n","Reusing existing connection to www.dropbox.com:443.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found\n","Location: https://uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/get/AjzPSePvGb0BHoTcpOMyaVFbMZnr4Sv3S4e7fGsv-it1K8QAMhv9okwYdZyizFJPI1YLLmzxNzCo6_aqlZZdzy91IzKq8CoytjxPrD1RMFg2vw/file?dl=1# [following]\n","--2019-06-30 01:12:59--  https://uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/get/AjzPSePvGb0BHoTcpOMyaVFbMZnr4Sv3S4e7fGsv-it1K8QAMhv9okwYdZyizFJPI1YLLmzxNzCo6_aqlZZdzy91IzKq8CoytjxPrD1RMFg2vw/file?dl=1\n","Resolving uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com (uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com)... 162.125.81.6, 2620:100:6031:6::a27d:5106\n","Connecting to uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com (uc04e0a125eff9ec13572a9a6a9f.dl.dropboxusercontent.com)|162.125.81.6|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 1759259 (1.7M) [application/binary]\n","Saving to: ‘sst2.tar.gz?dl=1’\n","\n","sst2.tar.gz?dl=1    100%[===================>]   1.68M  3.94MB/s    in 0.4s    \n","\n","2019-06-30 01:13:00 (3.94 MB/s) -

For each filter of length `K` convolved with a signal of length `T`, the output signal will be `T - K + 1`.  To handle the ends of the signal where the filter is hanging off (e.g. centered at 0), we will add some zero-padding.  So if we have a filter of length `K=3`, we want to zero-pad the temporal signal by a single pad value on both ends of the signal.\n","\n","We are going to support multiple parallel filters, so we can add a `torch.nn.Conv1d` for each filter length, followed by a `torch.nn.ReLU` activation layer.  Since we have more than one of these, we will create a `nn.ModuleList` to track them.

This behavior is not limited to a single dataset -- these results have been shown over and over.  Also, using PyTorch, we were able to code an entire pipeline in this minimalistic notebook.\n","\n","### Pre-trained embeddings often help\n","\n","We can see that pre-trained embeddings can have a massive impact on the performance of our models, especially for smaller datasets.  The `word2vec` algorithm caused an explosion in the NLP community -- even though pre-training embeddings had been widely studied prior to that work, the results were reliable and fast.  `GloVe` and `fastText` embeddings came shortly thereafter, and all 3 models are in quite common use today.  The code above can load any of these flavors of embeddings and incorporate them into downstream models for large improvements.\n","\n","For large datasets, like those used in Language Modeling and Neural Machine Translation, models are typically trained from random embeddings, which are sufficient in those cases.\n","\n","### Incorporating pre-trained embeddings into your model is simple\n","\n","The file formats are very simple to read and can be incorporated with only a few lines of code.  In some cases, memory-mapping the file can increase the loading speed.  This is implemented in [Baseline](https://github.com/dpressel/baseline/)\n","\n","### Some Further Resources\n","\n","- [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks, Karpathy, 2015](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)\n","- Tensorflow tutorial for word2vec: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec\n","- Tensorflow docs on feature columns (for images above): https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns\n","- Xin Rong, wrote some amazing software to visualize word embeddings and the training process.
