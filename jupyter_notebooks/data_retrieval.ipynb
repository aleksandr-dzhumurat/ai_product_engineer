It shows 1000mg as advertised & another little label says 12mg bc 12 is on the periodic table for magnesium!  I realize not everyone takes chemistry, but 4 ppl liked his review & so misinformation is spreading.  This works. If however you are on opiate level medications that are causing constipation you should talk to your pain dr or your gastrointestinal dr & ask for a medication called Linzess which works must better & must faster, but is unnecessary for most people.  If magnesium is working for you just make sure to take it with food & drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.  Staying hydrated will really help.  Before switching to Linzess I used to take one 1,000 mg pill am & pm every day with meals & always with an 8 ounce glass of water or other liquid.',\n",
