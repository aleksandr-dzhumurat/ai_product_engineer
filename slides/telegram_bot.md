# Telegram bot

- Open Telegram and search for the **BotFather**.
- Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command.
- Follow the instructions to:
    - Name your bot.
    - Choose a username ending with "bot" (e.g., `my_first_bot`).
- Once created, BotFather will provide you with a **bot token**. Save it; you'll need it for your script.
